non-unique keys and no value is found, the empty list is returned.  If
the btree has unique keys and no value is found, the result depends on
the ERRORP option: if ERRORP is true, a btree-search-error is

IF-EXISTS can be either :OVERWRITE (default) or :ERROR.

If the btree has unique keys (see BTREE-UNIQUE-KEYS-P) and KEY is
already associated with another (according to BTREE-VALUE=) value, the
result depends on the IF-EXISTS option: if IF-EXISTS is :OVERWRITE,
the old value is overwriten; if IF-EXISTS is :ERROR, a
BTREE-KEY-ALREADY-PRESENT-ERROR is signaled.

For btrees with non-unique keys, the IF-EXISTS option is ignored and
VALUE is just added to the list of values associated with KEY (unless
VALUE is already associated with KEY; in that case nothing
happens)."))

key is in the specified interval (this means that FUNCTION can be
called with the same key more than once for btrees with non-unique
keys). FUNCTION must be a binary function; the first argument is the
btree key, the second argument is an associated value.

MIN, MAX, INCLUDE-MIN and INCLUDE-MAX specify the interval.  The
interval is left-open if MIN is nil, right-open if MAX is nil.  The
interval is inclusive on the left if INCLUDE-MIN is true (and
exclusive on the left otherwise).  The interval is inclusive on the
right if INCLUDE-MAX is true (and exclusive on the right otherwise).

ORDER is either :ASCENDING (default) or :DESCENDING."))
